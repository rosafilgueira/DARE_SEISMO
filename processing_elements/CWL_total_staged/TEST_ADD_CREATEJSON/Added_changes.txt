PRELIMINARY CHANGES.

The download of waveforms still does not work if we add the intermediate step of creating the json input for download. More tests are required.
Important: the data.zip file in this folder has been removed so the link to this file should be changed.

When the dispel4py workflow works copy and paste the required changes in the scripts of this directory.

DO NOT REMOVE THE FILES IN THIS FOLDER!
